# Changelog

All notable changes to `unitprep-ui` are documented here. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versioning
follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Versioned
independently from `unitprep-api` — the two release on their own
cadences and are not required to share a version number.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- "Clients" left-nav entry and a per-client workspace
  (`/clients/[clientId]`) with horizontal tabs (Client Info, Dedup, Unit
  Groups) — the first cut of the "Client Prep" navigation model. Tabs
  are reachable in any order and none block the others.
- Client Info tab: editable placeholder fields (contact, signer, bank
  account, address, Dropbox folder path) and a QMS API placeholder
  section. Frontend-only — no backend persistence exists yet; state
  lives in the browser tab's `sessionStorage` and is lost on close.
- Duplicate Tenant Check (dedup) is now reachable through the main
  navigation instead of only a standalone `/dedup` URL.

### Changed
- Group Prep and Dedup routes moved under `/clients/[clientId]/...`
  (e.g. `/clients/[clientId]/unit-groups`, `/clients/[clientId]/dedup`).
  The old top-level `/`, `/dedup`, `/results/[sessionId]`,
  `/export/[sessionId]` routes are retired; `/` now redirects to
  `/clients`.

### Fixed
- `DiscoveryPage`'s session-expired redirect was hardcoded to `/`,
  which now lands on the Clients list instead of back to the client's
  own Unit Groups tab — a regression from the route move above. It now
  takes an `onSessionExpired` callback from its parent route, same
  pattern already used by `onBack`/`onHome` elsewhere.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-08

### Added
- Inline correction fields on the validation results page for
  single-value fixes (e.g. Width/Length) directly against the flagged
  unit, without re-uploading.
- "Not a dimensioned unit" action for catalog entries that legitimately
  have no dimensions (an office, an owner's apartment, etc.).
- "I've reviewed the errors above and want to export anyway"
  acknowledge-and-override control for unresolved validation errors.
- `SessionExpiredPage`, shown on the results, export, and discovery
  pages whenever the backend reports a session as no longer found,
  instead of a confusing empty/zero result.
- Error vs. Warning severity split in the validation issue list.
- `GET /api/health` — liveness/version check mirroring `unitprep-api`'s
  `GET /health`, reporting the version from `package.json` (kept in
  sync automatically via `next.config.ts`).

### Changed
- Validation issue detail now shows the specific affected unit ids
  instead of only a count.
